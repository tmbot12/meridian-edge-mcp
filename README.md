# Meridian Edge MCP Server

Query real-time prediction market consensus data directly from Claude and other AI assistants via the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).

Ask Claude: *"What does the prediction market say about the Lakers game tonight?"* and get a live answer.

This MCP server gives Claude access to **Meridian Edge** — aggregated prediction market consensus data from multiple regulated prediction markets, updated every 10 minutes.

**5 tools available to Claude:**

| Tool | What it returns |
|------|----------------|
| `get_consensus` | Aggregated consensus probabilities for sports/politics events |
| `get_opportunities` | Events where prediction markets show notable divergence |
| `get_signals` | Recent directional market moves |
| `get_markets` | Active markets currently being tracked |
| `get_settlements` | Recently settled events with verified outcomes |
